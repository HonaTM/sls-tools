Configuration is defined in the ```*.js``` file and can be structured to any need. Main ```*.js``` file must export a
configuration object. The structure of the object and mandatory fields is described below.

### config.js

```js
module.exports = [
    {

            branch: "...", // active branch name

## Changelog

### 1.5.0-RC1
Optimized error handling

### 1.5.0-RC
First iteration which is not covering whole implementation set, specifically lock feature.

* Added [dependency-manager](app/command/dependency-manager/readme.md) feature allowing user to analyze or lock dependencies. Analysis can be also visualized into the CSV or bookkit page.
* Added git support to clone, fetch, pull, checkout specific GIT repository and branch for any uuApp based on the configuration definition.
* Optimized configuration loader module to not load unnecessary configuration for the executed command

### 1.4.1
* prompt feature added for asking user before execution interactively in the command line whether it is allowed to proceed
    * default behavior can be by-passed by the specifying the ```--noprompt``` parameter
* option to visualize k8s export type - config map is converted from yaml into JSON format
* config map is always stored to both ```yaml``` and ```json``` format

### 1.4.0
* environment support added
  * to define multiple environments, simply export an array of invividual configuration objects with its own ```uuApp```, ```exports```, ```checks```, etc... definitions
  * single environmnet via single object export is still supported
  
### 1.3.0

* [check](app/command/check/readme.md) command visualization output extended to provide a dashboard overview of all successful and unsuccessful
  checks
* added *description* attribute support for every individual check

### 1.2.0

* [check](app/command/check/readme.md) command support for URL output verification
* email notifications for check command

### 1.1.0

* improved command line interface to be more structured, i.e. ```sls-tools export``` command will display help related
  to the export command only.
* visualization export improvement - added support to visualize objects

## TODO
- call
    - same as export but only calls the URLs, does not store anything
    - support to load the dtoIn list file and execute the dtoIns against same command (replacement for uuCommander)
    - modes
        - ```calls``` array with same definition as check item
            - for every dtoIn uuApp is specified individually, same as group, etc
        - dtoIn list file path
            - support to load file
            - define command to call, uuApp, + method
        - define exact URL to call plus dtoIn
- compare
    - suitable for fullExport comparison
- authorization
    - support oidc-plus4u-vault
    - store token for every uuApp individually into file system and reuse it if possible
